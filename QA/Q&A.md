1. **What is Docker's host network mode?**

- **Answer:** In host mode, a container shares the hostâ€™s network stack, which means it uses the hostâ€™s IP address for network communication instead of creating its own virtual network.

1. **What is a Docker overlay network?**

- **Answer:** An overlay network is used to allow containers to communicate across different Docker hosts. It is mainly used in Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.

- docker system prune

### Advanced Docker Topics (Continued)

1. **How does Docker handle logging for containers?**

- **Answer:** Docker provides several logging drivers such as json-file, syslog, journald, and fluentd to handle logging. You can set the logging driver using the --log-driver flag:
- docker run --log-driver=syslog my-image

1. **What is Docker image layering?**
